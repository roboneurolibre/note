### 2.7 &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; Dashboard

To widely disseminate the challenge results, a web-based dashboard was developed (Figure 2, https://rrsg2020.dashboards.neurolibre.org). The landing page (Figure 2-a) showcases the relationship between the phantom and brain datasets acquired at different sites/vendors. Selecting the Phantom or In Vivo icons and then clicking an ROI will display whisker plots for that region. Additional sections of the dashboard allow for displaying statistics summaries for both sets of data, a magnitude vs complex data fitting comparison, and hierarchical shift function analyses.
