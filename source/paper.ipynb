    "<b>Purpose:</b> T1 mapping is a widely used quantitative MRI technique, but its reproducibility remains inconsistent among research groups. In 2019, the ISMRM Reproducible Research study group (RRSG) and Quantitative MR study group (qMRSG) jointly launched a T1 mapping reproducibility challenge. The goal was to explore if an independently-implemented imaging protocol at multiple centers could reliably measure T1 using inversion recovery in a standardized phantom. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "<b>Methods:</b> To conduct the challenge, a gold standard protocol and fitting algorithm to measure T1 maps from the inversion recovery experiment was chosen (Barral et al. 2010). Participants who lacked access to the standard ISMRM/NIST phantom were encouraged to acquire healthy human brain data instead. Data submission, sharing, pipeline development, and analysis scripts were done on open-source platforms for reproducibility and  transparency.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "<b>Results:</b> Nineteen participants submitted data, resulting in a total of 41 datasets acquired in phantoms and 56 datasets in healthy human subjects. Most phantom datasets produced good T1 results relative to the temperature-correct reference values within the human range of T1 values. Inter-participant mean COV was 6.1% for phantom measurements, nearly two times higher than an intra-participant COV (2.9%). A similar trend was observed in the human data (inter-/intra- participant COV was 6.0/2.9 % genu and 16/6.9 % in the cortical GM).\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "<b>Conclusion:</b> This challenge generated a large database of inversion recovery T1 mapping open datasets across several sites and MRI vendors. In addition, a common fitting and analysis pipeline was developed, which could be used by the community to develop more robust T1 mapping techniques in the future.\n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Quantitative MRI (qMRI) has a reproducibility problem (Keenan et al. 2019). Despite the promise that qMRI improves specificity and reproducibility of measurements over clinical MRI scans, few qMRI techniques have entered the clinic. Even the most fundamental MR parameters cannot be measured with sufficient reproducibility and precision across clinical scanners to pass the second of six stages of technical assessment for clinical biomarkers (Fryback and Thornbury 1991; Schweitzer 2016; Seiberlich et al. 2020). Nearly half a century has passed since the first quantitative MRI maps (spin-lattice relaxation time, T1) were reported (Pykett and Mansfield 1978), yet there is still disagreement in reported values for his fundamental parameter (T1) across different sites, vendors, and implementations (Stikov et al. 2015). \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Amongst fundamental MRI parameters, T1 holds significant importance. It represents the time it takes for longitudinal magnetization to recover after being disturbed by an RF pulse. The T1 value varies based on molecular mobility and magnetic field strength (Bottomley et al. 1984; Wansapura et al. 1999; Dieringer et al. 2014), making it a valuable parameter for distinguishing between tissue types. Accurate knowledge of T1 values is essential for optimizing clinical MRI pulse sequences for contrast and time efficiency (Ernst and Anderson 1966; Redpath and Smith 1994; Tofts 1997) and as a calibration parameter for other quantitative MRI techniques (Sled and Pike 2001; Yuan et al. 2012). Amongst the number of techniques to measure T1, inversion recovery (IR) (Drain 1949; Hahn 1949) is widely held as being the gold standard T1 mapping technique, as it is very robust against other effects (e.g. B1 inhomogeneity) or potential errors in measurements (e.g. insufficient spoiling) (Stikov et al. 2015). However, because the technique requires a long repetition time (TR > T1), it is very slow and impractical for whole-organ measurements, limiting its clinical use. In practice, it is mostly used as a reference to validate other T1 mapping techniques, such as variable flip angle imaging (VFA) (Fram et al. 1987; Deoni, Rutt, and Peters 2003; Cheng and Wright 2006) and MP2RAGE (Marques et al. 2010). \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Efforts have been made to develop quantitative MRI phantoms to assist in standardizing T1 mapping methods (Keenan et al. 2018). A quantitative MRI standard system phantom was created in a joint project between ISMRM and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Stupic et al. 2021), and has since been commercialized (Premium System Phantom, CaliberMRI, Boulder, Colorado). The spherical phantom has a 57-element fiducial array containing spheres with doped liquids that model a wide range of T1, T2, and PD values. The reference values of each sphere were measured using NMR at 1.5T and 3.0T. The standardized concentration for relaxometry values established as references by NIST are also used by another company for their quantitative relaxometry MRI phantoms (Gold Standard Phantoms Ltd., Rochester, England). The cardiac TIMES phantom (Captur et al. 2016) is another commercially available system phantom used for T1, focusing on T1 and T2 values in blood and heart muscles, pre- and post-contrast. The ISMRM/NIST phantom has been used in a few large multicenter studies already, such as . (Bane et al. 2018) where they compared measurements at eight sites on a single phantom using the inversion recovery and VFA T1 mapping protocols recommended by NIST for their phantom, as well as some site-specific imaging protocols used for DCE. In another study led by NIST researchers (Keenan et al. 2021), T1 measurements were done at two clinical field strengths (1.5T and 3.0T) and 27 MRI systems (three vendors) using the recommended NIST protocols. That study found no significant relationship between T1 discrepancies of the measurements and the MRI vendors used.\n",

    "The 2020 ISMRM reproducibility challenge posed the following question: <b>will an imaging protocol independently-implemented at multiple centers reliably measure what is considered one of the fundamental MR parameters (T1) using the most robust technique (inversion recovery) in a standardized phantom (ISMRM/NIST system phantom)</b>. The challenge aimed at assessing the variability in measurements due to different groups reproducing a protocol from a specific publication (Barral et al. 2010). As the focus of this challenge was on reproducibility, the challenge design emphasized the use of reproducible research practices, such as sharing code, pipelines, data, and scripts to reproduce figures. To be more inclusive and broaden participation, participants were also invited to data acquired on healthy subjects if they did not have access to the necessary ISMRM/NIST system phantom, provided that their local and institutional ethics protocols permitted it.\n",

    "An overview of the T1 results for the submitted NIST phantom datasets are displayed in Figure 3. The same data is presented in each column with different axes types (linear, log, and error) to better visualize the results. The left column (a,d) shows the mean T1 with their standard deviations in each of the 14 ROIs are plotted against temperature-corrected reference T1 values using linear axes for a representative dataset (a) and all datasets (d). The middle column (b,e) displays the same mean T1 datasets as (a,d) but using log-log axes. The right column (c,f) displays the error (%) of the measured T1 relative to the temperature-corrected NIST reference values; the dotted lines represent a ±10% error. Figure 3a shows a strong linear trend and slight underestimation (slope = 0.98, intercept = -14 ms) for this dataset in comparison to the reference T1 values. However, this trend breaks down for low T1 values (T1 < 100-200 ms), as seen in the log-log plot (Figure 3b), which was expected because the imaging protocol is optimized for human T1 values (T1 > 500 ms). Errors exceeding 10% are observed for T1 values of phantom spheres below this threshold (Figure 3c). These trends are observed for the entire-dataset plots as well (Figure 3d-f). More variability is seen in Figure 3d around the identity diagonal at very high T1 (T1 ~ 2000 ms) than towards the WM-GM values (T1 ~ 600-1400 ms), which is less apparent in the log-log plot (Figure 3e). In addition to the low T1 values exceeding the 10% error threshold (Figure 3f), a few measurements with outlier values (~3-4) human tissue range were observed in the human tissue range.\n",

    "Inter-participant coefficient of variations (COV) were calculated by selecting one single T1 map submitted per challenge participant and calculating the COV of the T1  means per sphere. The average inter-participant COV across the first five spheres representing the expected range in the human brain was 6.1 % (sphere 1 = 4.7 %, sphere 2 = 3.1 %, sphere 3 = 6.3 %, sphere 4 = 12.8 %, sphere 5 = 7.3 %). Two sites were clear outliers that had particular issues for sphere 4, likely due to a combination of an implementation error and a resulting uncertainty of where the signal null lies for his four-TI measurement at that T1 value; by removing these outliers, the mean inter-participant COV reduces to 4.1 % (sphere 1 = 5.4 %, sphere 2 = 3. 5%, sphere 3 = 2.5 %, sphere 4 = 4.2 %, sphere 5 = 4.9 %). One participant measured T1 maps with one phantom using one implemented protocol at 7 different sites using a single manufacturer, and so a mean intra-participant COV across the first five spheres for this case was calculated to be 2.9 % (sphere 1 = 4.9 %, sphere 2 = 3.5 %, sphere 3 = 2.6 %, sphere 4 = 2.0 %, sphere 5 = 1.6 %). \n",

The bottom row in each panel (gray markers) shows the average trend of bootstrapped differences at each decile in milliseconds (e.g., a 39ms median (q5) underestimation trend in Sphere 3).

    "​The direction of the measurement error in the phantom is influenced by both the measurement site and the reference value, as indicated by the individual shift functions (Figure 5). For example, at sphere 1 (~2000 ms), nearly half of the measurements (20 shown in total) are positioned on each side of the zero-crossing. On the other hand, for sphere 3 (~1s), nearly all the measurements show underestimation as shift functions are located below the zero-crossing. Bootstrapped differences capture these trends, indicating a dominant overestimation at sphere 1 (median difference of +17ms) and underestimation at sphere 3 (median difference of -39ms). High-density intervals associated with these median differences do not indicate a common pattern for the former (intervals cross zero), whereas they reveal a notable underestimation trend at sphere 3 (intervals do not include zero). A similar common pattern is also observed for sphere 2 (median overestimation of 35ms). In addition, the shape of individual shift functions conveys information about how voxel-wise distributions differ. For example, curved lines in sphere 2 from two different sites reveal that some of the (ROI selected) voxels show drastically higher underestimation that cannot be captured by comparisons of central tendency alone. Lastly, the spread of shift functions around the zero-crossing does not indicate vendor-specific clustering for the selected measurements and reference values.\n",

    "Figure 6 summarizes the results from human datasets submitted to this challenge, showing mean and standard deviation T1 values from the WM (genu) and GM (cerebral cortex) ROIs. The top plot collapses all datasets for each site, while the bottom plot shows each dataset separately. Mean WM T1 values across all submissions was 828 ± 38 ms in the genu and 854 ± 50 ms in the splenium, and mean GM T1 values were 1548 ± 156 ms in the cortex and 1188 ± 133 ms in the deep GM, with less variations overall in WM compared to GM possibly due to better ROI placement and less partial voluming in WM. Inter-participant coefficients of variation (COV) for independently-implemented imaging protocols were calculated using one T1 map measurement per submission that most closely matched the proposed protocol, and were 6.0% for genu, 11% for splenium, 16% for cortical GM and 22% for deep GM. One site (site 9) measured multiple subjects on three scanners using two different vendors, and so intra-participant COVs for these centrally-implemented protocols were calculated over acquired T1 maps from this site, and were 2.9% for genu, 3.5% for splenium, 6.9 % for cortical GM and 7.8% for deep GM. It’s important that this site also had the best slice positioning, cutting through the AC-PC line and genu for proper ROI placement, particularly for the corpus callosum and deep GM.\n",

    "Nineteen research groups participated in a reproducibility challenge by independently-implementing an inversion recovery T1 mapping acquisition protocol and measuring a standard quantitative MRI phantom and/or human brains at 27 MRI sites, using three different vendors (GE, Philips, Siemens). The collaborative effort produced an open-source database of 97 T1 mapping datasets, including 41 ISMRM/NIST phantom and 56 human brain datasets. A standardized T1 processing pipeline was developed for different dataset types, including magnitude-only and complex data. Additionally, Jupyter notebooks that can be executed in containerized environments were developed for quality assurance visualization and analyses. An interactive web-based dashboard was also developed to allow for easy exploration of the challenge results in a web-browser.\n",

    "The challenge focused on exploring the reproducibility of the gold standard inversion recovery T1 mapping method reported in one paper (Barral et al. 2010). Participants were instructed to use the imaging protocol reported in this paper that was optimized for human brain T1 values. The paper also shared the necessary code to robustly process inversion recovery T1 mapping data, and is particularly effective even when using a shorter TR (TR ~ T1) than typically reported (TR ~ 5 T1). To evaluate the accuracy of the resulting T1 values, the challenge used the standard ISMRM/NIST phantom with fiducial spheres having T1 values expected in human brain tissue, ranging from 500 to 2000 ms (see Figure 3). As anticipated for this protocol, there was a decrease in the accuracy in measurements for spheres with T1 below 300 ms. Overall, the majority of the independently implemented imaging protocols from various sites resulted in good T1 estimates, with only a few exceptions. Using the NIST phantom, we report that sites that independently-implemented the imaging protocol resulted in an inter-participant mean COV (6.1 %) that was two-times higher than that for an intra-participant mean COV measured at seven sites (2.9 %). A similar trend was observed in vivo. Inter-participant COV for WM (genu) was 6.0 % and GM (cortex) was 16.5 % vs the intra-participant COV that was 2.9 % and 6.9%, with generally higher COVs relative to the phantom measurements likely due to biological variability.\n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "The work done during this challenge involved a multi-enter quantitative T1 mapping study using the NIST phantom across various sites. This work overlaps with two recent studies (Bane et al. 2018; Keenan et al. 2021). (Bane et al. 2018) focused on the reproducibility of two standard quantitative T1 techniques (inversion recovery and variable flip angle) and a wide variety of site-specific T1 mapping protocols for DCE, mostly shorter VFA protocols, which were implemented at eight imaging centers covering the same 3 MRI vendors as were submitted to the challenge GE/Philips/Siemens). The inter-platform coefficient of variation for the standard inversion recovery T1 protocol of 5.46% at 3.0 T, which was substantially lower than for the standard VFA protocol (22.87%). However, Bane et al.’s work differed from the challenge in several ways. First, the standard imaging protocol for inversion recovery used by Bane et al. had more inversion times (14 compared to the challenge’s 4) to cover the entire range of T1 values of the phantom. Secondly, Bane et al. used a single traveling phantom for all sites, whereas the challenge used a total of 8 different phantoms (some were shared amongst people who participated independently). Thirdly,  Bane et al. averaged the signals within each ROI of each sphere prior to fitting for the T1 values, whereas the challenge pipeline fits the T1 values in a per-voxel basis and only subsequently calculates the mean/median/std. They also only acquired magnitude data, in contrast to the challenge where participants were encouraged to submit both complex and magnitude-only data, where we observed that for the Barral et al. fitting model and protocol, there is no substantial difference in quality of fit for the human range of T1 values. Lastly, the implementations of the common inversion recovery protocols were fully standardized (full protocol) across all the platforms (except for two exceptions where one manufacturer couldn’t achieve the lowest TI) which was imposed and coordinated by the principal researchers. In contrast, the challenge sought to explore the variations that would occur for a less-restricted protocol (Table 2) that is independently-implemented at multiple centers, which more closely emulates the quantitative MR research flow (publication of a technique and protocol →  independently implement the pulse sequence and/or protocol → use the new implementation independently in a study → publish). Of note, in the challenge, one participating group submitted large multicenter datasets they coordinated themselves which emulates the question studied by (Bane et al. 2018) by imaging a single phantom across at 7 different imaging sites, albeit doing so on a single manufacturer. Using this subset, the mean cross-site COV was 2.9 % (range: 1.6 - 4.9 %) for the first five spheres, which is in agreement with the range of observations for all spheres by (Bane et al. 2018) at 3T using their full inversion recovery protocol (COV = 5.46 %; range: 0.99 - 14.6 %). \n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Another study, (Keenan et al. 2021), also investigated the accuracy of T1 mapping techniques using a single ISMRM/NIST system phantom at multiple sites and on multiple platforms. Like (Bane et al. 2018), they used an inversion recovery imaging protocol optimized for the full range of T1 values represented in the ISMRM/NIST phantom, which consisted of 9 to 10 inversion times and a TR of 4500 ms (TR ~ 5T1 of WM).  They reported no consistent pattern of differences in measured inversion recovery T1 values across MRI vendors for the two T1 mapping techniques they used (inversion recovery and VFA). They observed relative errors between their T1 measurements and the reference values of the phantom to be below 10% for all T1 values and highest at the lowest and highest T1 values of the phantom.\n",

    "There are some important things to note about this challenge. Firstly, we’d like to highlight that the submissions for this challenge were due in March 2020, which was at the height of the early days of COVID-10 pandemic lockdown. Despite this, many participants were able to submit their datasets and continued to work on the challenge, so we’d like to extend our gratitude to those who could. The lockdowns did pose some challenges, as some groups intended on scanning more data, and others intended on submitting rescan data that they could no longer do.\n",

    "This reproducibility challenge did not aim to determine a winning submission based on the most accurate measurements using the protocol. Instead, it aimed to compare differences between independently-implemented protocols. Crowning a winner was not feasible due to concerns that participants may have micro-optimized their inversion recovery protocols, leading to a broader range of differences in implementations across MRI vendors. Reflecting on this issue, one solution could have been to ask participants to acquire two datasets using the phantom – the original inversion recovery protocol by (Barral et al. 2010), and a second T1 mapping measurement using the rapid technique of their choice.The winner would have been the submission whose rapid T1 map closely matched the original inversion recovery protocol, while also being acquired in a clinically feasible time. This approach could help future qMRI reproducibility challenges in the future.\n",

    "The 2020 Reproducibility Challenge, jointly organized by the Reproducible Research and Quantitative MR ISMRM study groups, led to the creation of a large open database of standard quantitative MR phantom and human brain inversion recovery T1 maps. These maps were measured using independently-implemented imaging protocols on three different scanner manufacturers. All collected data, processing pipeline code, computational environment files, and analysis scripts were shared with the goal of promoting reproducible research practices. The differences in stability between independently-implemented (inter-participants) and centrally shared (intra-participant) protocols observed both in phantoms could help inform future meta-analyses of quantitative MRI metrics (Mancini et al. 2020) and better guide multi-center collaborations.\n",
