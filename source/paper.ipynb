    "Quantitative MRI (qMRI) has a reproducibility problem (Keenan et al. 2019). Despite the promise that qMRI improves specificity and reproducibility of measurements over clinical MRI scans, few qMRI techniques have entered the clinic. Even the most fundamental MR parameters cannot be measured with sufficient reproducibility and precision across clinical scanners to pass the second of six stages of technical assessment for clinical biomarkers (Fryback and Thornbury 1991; Schweitzer 2016; Seiberlich et al. 2020). Nearly half a century has passed since the first quantitative MRI maps (spin-lattice relaxation time, T1) were reported (Pykett and Mansfield 1978), yet there is still disagreement in reported values for his fundamental parameter (T1) across different sites, vendors, and implementations (Stikov et al. 2015). \n",

    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Amongst fundamental MRI parameters, T1 holds significant importance. It represents the time it takes for longitudinal magnetization to recover after being disturbed by an RF pulse. The T1 value varies based on molecular mobility and magnetic field strength (Bottomley et al. 1984; Wansapura et al. 1999; Dieringer et al. 2014), making it a valuable parameter for distinguishing between tissue types. Accurate knowledge of T1 values is essential for optimizing clinical MRI pulse sequences for contrast and time efficiency (Ernst and Anderson 1966; Redpath and Smith 1994; Tofts 1997) and as a calibration parameter for other quantitative MRI techniques (Sled and Pike 2001; Yuan et al. 2012). Amongst the number of techniques to measure T1, inversion recovery (IR) (Drain 1949; Hahn 1949) is widely held as being the gold standard T1 mapping technique, as it is very robust against other effects (e.g. B1 inhomogeneity) or potential errors in measurements (e.g. insufficient spoiling) (Stikov et al. 2015). However, because the technique requires a long repetition time (TR > T1), it is very slow and impractical for whole-organ measurements, limiting its clinical use. In practice, it is mostly used as a reference to validate other T1 mapping techniques, such as variable flip angle imaging (VFA) (Fram et al. 1987; Deoni, Rutt, and Peters 2003; Cheng and Wright 2006) and MP2RAGE (Marques et al. 2010). \n",

    "<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\n",
    "Efforts have been made to develop quantitative MRI phantoms to assist in standardizing T1 mapping methods (Keenan et al. 2018). A quantitative MRI standard system phantom was created in a joint project between ISMRM and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (Stupic et al. 2021), and has since been commercialized (Premium System Phantom, CaliberMRI, Boulder, Colorado). The spherical phantom has a 57-element fiducial array containing spheres with doped liquids that model a wide range of T1, T2, and PD values. The reference values of each sphere were measured using NMR at 1.5T and 3.0T. The standardized concentration for relaxometry values established as references by NIST are also used by another company for their quantitative relaxometry MRI phantoms (Gold Standard Phantoms Ltd., Rochester, England). The cardiac TIMES phantom (Captur et al. 2016) is another commercially available system phantom used for T1, focusing on T1 and T2 values in blood and heart muscles, pre- and post-contrast. The ISMRM/NIST phantom has been used in a few large multicenter studies already, such as . (Bane et al. 2018) where they compared measurements at eight sites on a single phantom using the inversion recovery and VFA T1 mapping protocols recommended by NIST for their phantom, as well as some site-specific imaging protocols used for DCE. In another study led by NIST researchers (Keenan et al. 2021), T1 measurements were done at two clinical field strengths (1.5T and 3.0T) and 27 MRI systems (three vendors) using the recommended NIST protocols. That study found no significant relationship between T1 discrepancies of the measurements and the MRI vendors used.\n",

    "The 2020 ISMRM reproducibility challenge posed the following question: <b>will an imaging protocol independently-implemented at multiple centers reliably measure what is considered one of the fundamental MR parameters (T1) using the most robust technique (inversion recovery) in a standardized phantom (ISMRM/NIST system phantom)</b>. The challenge aimed at assessing the variability in measurements due to different groups reproducing a protocol from a specific publication (Barral et al. 2010). As the focus of this challenge was on reproducibility, the challenge design emphasized the use of reproducible research practices, such as sharing code, pipelines, data, and scripts to reproduce figures. To be more inclusive and broaden participation, participants were also invited to data acquired on healthy subjects if they did not have access to the necessary ISMRM/NIST system phantom, provided that their local and institutional ethics protocols permitted it.\n",

    "Data submissions for the challenge were managed through a dedicated repository on GitHub, accessible at https://github.com/rrsg2020/data_submission. This allowed transparent and open review of the submissions, as well as better standardization of the process. All datasets had to be converted to the NIfTI file format, and images from different TIs needed to be concatenated into the fourth (or “time”) dimension. Magnitude-only datasets required one NIfTI file, while complex datasets required two files (magnitude and phase, or real and imaginary). Additionally, a configuration file containing submission, dataset, and acquisition details (such as data type, submitter name and email, site details, phantom or volunteer details, and imaging protocol details) was required for each submitted dataset to ensure that the information was standardized and easily found. Each submission was reviewed to confirm that guidelines were followed, and then datasets and configuration files were uploaded to OSF.io. A Jupyter Notebook  (Kluyver et al. 2016; Beg et al. 2021) pipeline was used to generate T1 maps at this stage also for quality assurance. Links to the Jupyter Notebook for reproducing the T1 map were shared for each submission using the MyBinder platform, ensuring that computation environments were reproducible without the need for installation of software packages on peoples local computers.\n",

    "An overview of the T1 results for the submitted NIST phantom datasets are displayed in Figure 3. The same data is presented in each column with different axes types (linear, log, and error) to better visualize the results. The left column (a,d) shows the mean T1 with their standard deviations in each of the 14 ROIs are plotted against temperature-corrected reference T1 values using linear axes for a representative dataset (a) and all datasets (d). The middle column (b,e) displays the same mean T1 datasets as (a,d) but using log-log axes. The right column (c,f) displays the error (%) of the measured T1 relative to the temperature-corrected NIST reference values; the dotted lines represent a ±10% error. Figure 3a shows a strong linear trend and slight underestimation (slope = 0.98, intercept = -14 ms) for this dataset in comparison to the reference T1 values. However, this trend breaks down for low T1 values (T1 < 100-200 ms), as seen in the log-log plot (Figure 3b), which was expected because the imaging protocol is optimized for human T1 values (T1 > 500 ms). Errors exceeding 10% are observed for T1 values of phantom spheres below this threshold (Figure 3c). These trends are observed for the entire-dataset plots as well (Figure 3d-f). More variability is seen in Figure 3d around the identity diagonal at very high T1 (T1 ~ 2000 ms) than towards the WM-GM values (T1 ~ 600-1400 ms), which is less apparent in the log-log plot (Figure 3e). In addition to the low T1 values exceeding the 10% error threshold (Figure 3f), a few measurements with outlier values (~3-4) human tissue range were observed in the human tissue range.\n",

    "Inter-participant coefficient of variations (COV) were calculated by selecting one single T1 map submitted per challenge participant and calculating the COV of the T1  means per sphere. The average inter-participant COV across the first five spheres representing the expected range in the human brain was 6.1 % (sphere 1 = 4.7 %, sphere 2 = 3.1 %, sphere 3 = 6.3 %, sphere 4 = 12.8 %, sphere 5 = 7.3 %). Two sites were clear outliers that had particular issues for sphere 4, likely due to a combination of an implementation error and a resulting uncertainty of where the signal null lies for his four-TI measurement at that T1 value; by removing these outliers, the mean inter-participant COV reduces to 4.1 % (sphere 1 = 5.4 %, sphere 2 = 3. 5%, sphere 3 = 2.5 %, sphere 4 = 4.2 %, sphere 5 = 4.9 %). One participant measured T1 maps with one phantom using one implemented protocol at 7 different sites using a single manufacturer, and so a mean intra-participant COV across the first five spheres for this case was calculated to be 2.9 % (sphere 1 = 4.9 %, sphere 2 = 3.5 %, sphere 3 = 2.6 %, sphere 4 = 2.0 %, sphere 5 = 1.6 %). \n",

    "​The direction of the measurement error in the phantom is influenced by both the measurement site and the reference value, as indicated by the individual shift functions (Figure 5). For example, at sphere 1 (~2000 ms), nearly half of the measurements (20 shown in total) are positioned on each side of the zero-crossing. On the other hand, for sphere 3 (~1s), nearly all the measurements show underestimation as shift functions are located below the zero-crossing. Bootstrapped differences capture these trends, indicating a dominant overestimation at sphere 1 (median difference of +17ms) and underestimation at sphere 3 (median difference of -39ms). High-density intervals associated with these median differences do not indicate a common pattern for the former (intervals cross zero), whereas they reveal a notable underestimation trend at sphere 3 (intervals do not include zero). A similar common pattern is also observed for sphere 2 (median overestimation of 35ms). In addition, the shape of individual shift functions conveys information about how voxel-wise distributions differ. For example, curved lines in sphere 2 from two different sites reveal that some of the (ROI selected) voxels show drastically higher underestimation that cannot be captured by comparisons of central tendency alone. Lastly, the spread of shift functions around the zero-crossing does not indicate vendor-specific clustering for the selected measurements and reference values.\n",

    "Figure 6 summarizes the results from human datasets submitted to this challenge, showing mean and standard deviation T1 values from the WM (genu) and GM (cerebral cortex) ROIs. The top plot collapses all datasets for each site, while the bottom plot shows each dataset separately. Mean WM T1 values across all submissions was 828 ± 38 ms in the genu and 854 ± 50 ms in the splenium, and mean GM T1 values were 1548 ± 156 ms in the cortex and 1188 ± 133 ms in the deep GM, with less variations overall in WM compared to GM possibly due to better ROI placement and less partial voluming in WM. Inter-participant coefficients of variation (COV) for independently-implemented imaging protocols were calculated using one T1 map measurement per submission that most closely matched the proposed protocol, and were 6.0% for genu, 11% for splenium, 16% for cortical GM and 22% for deep GM. One site (site 9) measured multiple subjects on three scanners using two different vendors, and so intra-participant COVs for these centrally-implemented protocols were calculated over acquired T1 maps from this site, and were 2.9% for genu, 3.5% for splenium, 6.9 % for cortical GM and 7.8% for deep GM. It’s important that this site also had the best slice positioning, cutting through the AC-PC line and genu for proper ROI placement, particularly for the corpus callosum and deep GM.\n",
