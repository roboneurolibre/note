    abstract = {PURPOSE: To determine the in vitro accuracy, test-retest
repeatability, and interplatform reproducibility of T1
quantification protocols used for dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI
at 1.5 and 3 T. METHODS: A T1 phantom with 14 samples was imaged
at eight centers with a common inversion-recovery spin-echo
(IR-SE) protocol and a variable flip angle (VFA) protocol using
seven flip angles, as well as site-specific protocols (VFA with
different flip angles, variable repetition time, proton density,
and Look-Locker inversion recovery). Factors influencing the
accuracy (deviation from reference NMR T1 measurements) and
repeatability were assessed using general linear mixed models.
Interplatform reproducibility was assessed using coefficients of
variation. RESULTS: For the common IR-SE protocol, accuracy
(median error across platforms = 1.4-5.5\%) was influenced
predominantly by T1 sample (P < 10-6 ), whereas test-retest
repeatability (median error = 0.2-8.3\%) was influenced by the
scanner (P < 10-6 ). For the common VFA protocol, accuracy
(median error = 5.7-32.2\%) was influenced by field strength (P =
0.006), whereas repeatability (median error = 0.7-25.8\%) was
influenced by the scanner (P < 0.0001). Interplatform
reproducibility with the common VFA was lower at 3 T than 1.5 T
(P = 0.004), and lower than that of the common IR-SE protocol
(coefficient of variation 1.5T: VFA/IR-SE = 11.13\%/8.21\%, P =
0.028; 3 T: VFA/IR-SE = 22.87\%/5.46\%, P = 0.001). Among the
site-specific protocols, Look-Locker inversion recovery and VFA
(2-3 flip angles) protocols showed the best accuracy and
repeatability (errors < 15\%). CONCLUSIONS: The VFA protocols
with 2 to 3 flip angles optimized for different applications
achieved acceptable balance of extensive spatial coverage,
accuracy, and repeatability in T1 quantification (errors < 15\%).
Further optimization in terms of flip-angle choice for each
tissue application, and the use of B1 correction, are needed to
improve the robustness of VFA protocols for T1 mapping. Magn

@article{Bottomley1984-qx,
    abstract = {The longitudinal (T1) and transverse (T2) hydrogen (1H) nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation times of normal human and
animal tissue in the frequency range 1-100 MHz are compiled and
reviewed as a function of tissue type, NMR frequency,
temperature, species, in vivo versus in vitro status, time after
excision, and age. The dominant observed factors affecting T1 are
tissue type and NMR frequency (V). All tissue frequency
dispersions can be fitted to the simple expression T1 = AVB in
the range 1-100 MHz, with A and B tissue-dependent constants.
This equation provides as good or better fit to the data as
previous more complex formulas. T2 is found to be multicomponent,
essentially independent of NMR frequency, and dependent mainly on
tissue type. Mean and raw values of T1 and T2 for each tissue are
tabulated and/or plotted versus frequency and the fitting
parameters A, B and the standard deviations determined to
establish the normal range of relaxation times applicable to NMR
imaging. The mechanisms for tissue NMR relaxation are reviewed
with reference to the fast exchange two state (FETS) model of
water in biological systems, and an overview of the dynamic state
of water and macromolecular hydrogen compatible with the
frequency, temperature, and multicomponent data is postulated.
This suggests that 1H tissue T1 is determined predominantly by
intermolecular (possibly rotational) interactions between
macromolecules and a single bound hydration layer, and the T2 is
governed mainly by exchange diffusion of water between the bound
layer and a free water phase. Deficiencies in measurement
techniques are identified as major sources of data
irreproducibility.},

@article{Captur2016-xn,
    abstract = {BACKGROUND: T1 mapping and extracellular volume (ECV) have the
potential to guide patient care and serve as surrogate end-points
in clinical trials, but measurements differ between
cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) scanners and pulse
sequences. To help deliver T1 mapping to global clinical care, we
developed a phantom-based quality assurance (QA) system for
verification of measurement stability over time at individual
sites, with further aims of generalization of results across
sites, vendor systems, software versions and imaging sequences.
We thus created T1MES: The T1 Mapping and ECV Standardization
Program. METHODS: A design collaboration consisting of a
specialist MRI small-medium enterprise, clinicians, physicists
and national metrology institutes was formed. A phantom was
designed covering clinically relevant ranges of T1 and T2 in
blood and myocardium, pre and post-contrast, for 1.5 T and 3 T.
Reproducible mass manufacture was established. The device
received regulatory clearance by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) and Conformit{\'e} Europ{\'e}ene (CE) marking. RESULTS: The
T1MES phantom is an agarose gel-based phantom using nickel
chloride as the paramagnetic relaxation modifier. It was
reproducibly specified and mass-produced with a rigorously
repeatable process. Each phantom contains nine differently-doped
agarose gel tubes embedded in a gel/beads matrix. Phantoms were
free of air bubbles and susceptibility artifacts at both field
strengths and T1 maps were free from off-resonance artifacts. The
incorporation of high-density polyethylene beads in the main gel
fill was effective at flattening the B 1 field. T1 and T2 values
measured in T1MES showed coefficients of variation of 1 \% or
less between repeat scans indicating good short-term
reproducibility. Temperature dependency experiments confirmed
that over the range 15-30 °C the short-T1 tubes were more stable
with temperature than the long-T1 tubes. A batch of 69 phantoms
was mass-produced with random sampling of ten of these showing
coefficients of variations for T1 of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.45 \% and 0.49
$\pm$ 0.34 \% at 1.5 T and 3 T respectively. CONCLUSION: The
T1MES program has developed a T1 mapping phantom to CE/FDA
manufacturing standards. An initial 69 phantoms with a
multi-vendor user manual are now being scanned fortnightly in
centers worldwide. Future results will explore T1 mapping
sequences, platform performance, stability and the potential for
standardization.},

@article{Dieringer2014-qz,
    abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Visual but subjective reading of longitudinal
relaxation time (T1) weighted magnetic resonance images is
commonly used for the detection of brain pathologies. For this
non-quantitative measure, diagnostic quality depends on hardware
configuration, imaging parameters, radio frequency transmission
field (B1+) uniformity, as well as observer experience.
Parametric quantification of the tissue T1 relaxation parameter
offsets the propensity for these effects, but is typically time
consuming. For this reason, this study examines the feasibility
of rapid 2D T1 quantification using a variable flip angles (VFA)
approach at magnetic field strengths of 1.5 Tesla, 3 Tesla, and 7
Tesla. These efforts include validation in phantom experiments
and application for brain T1 mapping. METHODS: T1 quantification
included simulations of the Bloch equations to correct for slice
profile imperfections, and a correction for B1+. Fast gradient
echo acquisitions were conducted using three adjusted flip angles
for the proposed T1 quantification approach that was benchmarked
against slice profile uncorrected 2D VFA and an
inversion-recovery spin-echo based reference method. Brain T1
mapping was performed in six healthy subjects, one multiple
sclerosis patient, and one stroke patient. RESULTS: Phantom
experiments showed a mean T1 estimation error of (-63$\pm$1.5)\%
for slice profile uncorrected 2D VFA and (0.2$\pm$1.4)\% for the
proposed approach compared to the reference method. Scan time for
single slice T1 mapping including B1+ mapping could be reduced to
5 seconds using an in-plane resolution of (2$\times$2) mm2, which
equals a scan time reduction of more than 99\% compared to the
reference method. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that rapid
2D T1 quantification using a variable flip angle approach is
feasible at 1.5T/3T/7T. It represents a valuable alternative for
rapid T1 mapping due to the gain in speed versus conventional
approaches. This progress may serve to enhance the capabilities
of parametric MR based lesion detection and brain tissue
characterization.},

    abstract = {The MRI community is using quantitative mapping techniques to
complement qualitative imaging. For quantitative imaging to reach
its full potential, it is necessary to analyze measurements
across systems and longitudinally. Clinical use of quantitative
imaging can be facilitated through adoption and use of a standard
system phantom, a calibration/standard reference object, to
assess the performance of an MRI machine. The International
Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine AdHoc Committee on
Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance was established in
February 2007 to facilitate the expansion of MRI as a mainstream
modality for multi-institutional measurements, including, among
other things, multicenter trials. The goal of the Standards for
Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee was to provide a
framework to ensure that quantitative measures derived from MR
data are comparable over time, between subjects, between sites,
and between vendors. This paper, written by members of the
Standards for Quantitative Magnetic Resonance committee, reviews
standardization attempts and then details the need, requirements,
and implementation plan for a standard system phantom for
quantitative MRI. In addition, application-specific phantoms and
implementation of quantitative MRI are reviewed. Magn Reson Med

(MRI) measurement methods have led to improvements in accuracy,
repeatability, and acquisition speed, and have prompted renewed
interest to reevaluate the medical value of quantitative T1. The
purpose of this study was to determine the bias and
reproducibility of T1 measurements in a variety of MRI systems
with an eye toward assessing the feasibility of applying
diagnostic threshold T1 measurement across multiple clinical
sites. We used the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in
Medicine/National Institute of Standards and Technology
(ISMRM/NIST) system phantom to assess variations of T1
measurements, using a slow, reference standard inversion recovery
sequence and a rapid, commonly-available variable flip angle
sequence, across MRI systems at 1.5 tesla (T) (two vendors, with
number of MRI systems n = 9) and 3 T (three vendors, n = 18). We
compared the T1 measurements from inversion recovery and variable
flip angle scans to ISMRM/NIST phantom reference values using
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to test for statistical differences
between T1 measurements grouped according to MRI scanner
manufacturers and/or static field strengths. The inversion
recovery method had minor over- and under-estimations compared to
the NMR-measured T1 values at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Variable flip
angle measurements had substantially greater deviations from the
NMR-measured T1 values than the inversion recovery measurements.
At 3 T, the measured variable flip angle T1 for one vendor is
significantly different than the other two vendors for most of
the samples throughout the clinically relevant range of T1. There
was no consistent pattern of discrepancy between vendors. We
suggest establishing rigorous quality control procedures for
validating quantitative MRI methods to promote confidence and
stability in associated measurement techniques and to enable
translation of diagnostic threshold from the research center to
the entire clinical community.},

importance of myelination in healthy brain function and
neuropsychiatric diseases. Non-invasive microstructural magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) holds the potential to expand and
translate these insights to basic and clinical human research,
but the sensitivity and specificity of different MR markers to
myelination is a subject of debate. To consolidate current
knowledge on the topic, we perform a systematic review and
meta-analysis of studies that validate microstructural imaging by
combining it with myelin histology. We find meta-analytic
evidence for correlations between various myelin histology
metrics and markers from different MRI modalities, including
fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity, macromolecular pool,
magnetization transfer ratio, susceptibility and longitudinal
relaxation rate, but not mean diffusivity. Meta-analytic
correlation effect sizes range widely, between R2 = 0.26 and R2 =
0.82. However, formal comparisons between MRI-based myelin
markers are limited by methodological variability, inconsistent
reporting and potential for publication bias, thus preventing the
establishment of a single most sensitive strategy to measure
myelin with MRI. To facilitate further progress, we provide a
detailed characterisation of the evaluated studies as an online
resource. We also share a set of 12 recommendations for future
studies validating putative MR-based myelin markers and deploying

selective data acquisition, and 2) merging of data from multiple

regions of interest and pixel by pixel. T1 accuracy at different
heart rates derived from simulated ECG signals was tested in
phantoms. T1 estimates showed small systematic error for T1
values from 191 to 1196 ms. In vivo T1 mapping was performed in
two healthy volunteers and in one patient with acute myocardial

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: T1 mapping allows direct in-vivo quantitation of
microscopic changes in the myocardium, providing new diagnostic
insights into cardiac disease. Existing methods require long
breath holds that are demanding for many cardiac patients. In
this work we propose and validate a novel, clinically applicable,
pulse sequence for myocardial T1-mapping that is compatible with
typical limits for end-expiration breath-holding in patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Shortened MOdified Look-Locker
Inversion recovery (ShMOLLI) method uses sequential inversion
recovery measurements within a single short breath-hold. Full
recovery of the longitudinal magnetisation between sequential
inversion pulses is not achieved, but conditional interpretation
of samples for reconstruction of T1-maps is used to yield
accurate measurements, and this algorithm is implemented directly
on the scanner. We performed computer simulations for 100 ms<T1 <
2.7 s and heart rates 40-100 bpm followed by phantom validation
at 1.5T and 3T. In-vivo myocardial T1-mapping using this method
and the previous gold-standard (MOLLI) was performed in 10
healthy volunteers at 1.5T and 3T, 4 volunteers with contrast
injection at 1.5T, and 4 patients with recent myocardial
infarction (MI) at 3T. RESULTS: We found good agreement between
the average ShMOLLI and MOLLI estimates for T1 < 1200 ms. In
contrast to the original method, ShMOLLI showed no dependence on
heart rates for long T1 values, with estimates characterized by a
constant 4\% underestimation for T1 = 800-2700 ms. In-vivo,
ShMOLLI measurements required 9.0 $\pm$ 1.1 s (MOLLI = 17.6 $\pm$
2.9 s). Average healthy myocardial T1 s by ShMOLLI at 1.5T were
966 $\pm$ 48 ms (mean $\pm$ SD) and 1166 $\pm$ 60 ms at 3T. In MI
patients, the T1 in unaffected myocardium (1216 $\pm$ 42 ms) was
similar to controls at 3T. Ischemically injured myocardium showed
increased T1 = 1432 $\pm$ 33 ms (p < 0.001). The difference
between MI and remote myocardium was estimated 15\% larger by
ShMOLLI than MOLLI (p < 0.04) which suffers from heart rate
dependencies for long T1. The in-vivo variability within ShMOLLI
T1-maps was only 14\% (1.5T) or 18\% (3T) higher than the MOLLI
maps, but the MOLLI acquisitions were twice longer than ShMOLLI
acquisitions. CONCLUSION: ShMOLLI is an efficient method that
generates immediate, high-resolution myocardial T1-maps in a
short breath-hold with high precision. This technique provides a
valuable clinically applicable tool for myocardial tissue
characterisation.},

    abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantitative T1-mapping is rapidly becoming a
clinical tool in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to
objectively distinguish normal from diseased myocardium. The
usefulness of any quantitative technique to identify disease lies
in its ability to detect significant differences from an
established range of normal values. We aimed to assess the
variability of myocardial T1 relaxation times in the normal human
population estimated with recently proposed Shortened Modified
Look-Locker Inversion recovery (ShMOLLI) T1 mapping technique.
METHODS: A large cohort of healthy volunteers (n = 342, 50\%
females, age 11-69 years) from 3 clinical centres across two
countries underwent CMR at 1.5T. Each examination provided a
single average myocardial ShMOLLI T1 estimate using manually
drawn myocardial contours on typically 3 short axis slices
(average 3.4 $\pm$ 1.4), taking care not to include any blood
pool in the myocardial contours. We established the normal
reference range of myocardial and blood T1 values, and assessed
the effect of potential confounding factors, including artefacts,
partial volume, repeated measurements, age, gender, body size,
hematocrit and heart rate. RESULTS: Native myocardial ShMOLLI T1
was 962 $\pm$ 25 ms. We identify the partial volume as primary
source of potential error in the analysis of respective T1 maps
and use 1 pixel erosion to represent ``midwall myocardial'' T1,
resulting in a 0.9\% decrease to 953 $\pm$ 23 ms. Midwall
myocardial ShMOLLI T1 was reproducible with an intra-individual,
intra- and inter-scanner variability of $\leq$2\%. The principle
biological parameter influencing myocardial ShMOLLI T1 was the
female gender, with female T1 longer by 24 ms up to the age of 45
years, after which there was no significant difference from
males. After correction for age and gender dependencies, heart
rate was the only other physiologic factor with a small effect on
myocardial ShMOLLI T1 (6ms/10bpm). Left and right ventricular
blood ShMOLLI T1 correlated strongly with each other and also
with myocardial T1 with the slope of 0.1 that is justifiable by
the resting partition of blood volume in myocardial tissue.
Overall, the effect of all variables on myocardial ShMOLLI T1 was
within 2\% of relative changes from the average. CONCLUSION:
Native T1-mapping using ShMOLLI generates reproducible and
consistent results in normal individuals within 2\% of relative
changes from the average, well below the effects of most acute
forms of myocardial disease. The main potential confounder is the
partial volume effect arising from over-inclusion of neighbouring
tissue at the manual stages of image analysis. In the study of
cardiac conditions such as diffuse fibrosis or small focal
changes, the use of ``myocardial midwall'' T1, age and gender
matching, and compensation for heart rate differences may all
help to improve the method sensitivity in detecting subtle
changes. As the accuracy of current T1 measurement methods
remains to be established, this study does not claim to report an
accurate measure of T1, but that ShMOLLI is a stable and
reproducible method for T1-mapping.},

these basic approaches. For properties which can be measured in
multiple ways, each of these basic methods will be described in
separate chapters. Following the basics, a chapter in each
section presents more advanced and recently proposed techniques
for quantitative tissue property mapping, with a concluding
chapter on clinical applications. The reader will learn: The
basic physics behind tissue property mapping How to implement
basic pulse sequences for the quantitative measurement of tissue
properties The strengths and limitations to the basic and more
rapid methods for mapping the magnetic relaxation properties T1,
T2, and T2* The pros and cons for different approaches to

@article{Stupic2021-hu,
    abstract = {PURPOSE: A standard MRI system phantom has been designed and
fabricated to assess scanner performance, stability,
comparability and assess the accuracy of quantitative relaxation
time imaging. The phantom is unique in having traceability to the
International System of Units, a high level of precision, and
monitoring by a national metrology institute. Here, we describe
the phantom design, construction, imaging protocols, and
measurement of geometric distortion, resolution, slice profile,
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), proton-spin relaxation times, image
uniformity and proton density. METHODS: The system phantom,
designed by the International Society of Magnetic Resonance in
Medicine ad hoc committee on Standards for Quantitative MR, is a
200 mm spherical structure that contains a 57-element fiducial
array; two relaxation time arrays; a proton density/SNR array;
resolution and slice-profile insets. Standard imaging protocols
are presented, which provide rapid assessment of geometric
distortion, image uniformity, T1 and T2 mapping, image
resolution, slice profile, and SNR. RESULTS: Fiducial array
analysis gives assessment of intrinsic geometric distortions,
which can vary considerably between scanners and correction
techniques. This analysis also measures scanner/coil image
uniformity, spatial calibration accuracy, and local volume
distortion. An advanced resolution analysis gives both scanner
and protocol contributions. SNR analysis gives both temporal and
spatial contributions. CONCLUSIONS: A standard system phantom is
useful for characterization of scanner performance, monitoring a
scanner over time, and to compare different scanners. This type
of calibration structure is useful for quality assurance,
benchmarking quantitative MRI protocols, and to transition MRI
from a qualitative imaging technique to a precise metrology with
documented accuracy and uncertainty.},

penta-acetic acid (Gd-DTPA) data are examined. All models use
compartments representing the blood plasma and the abnormal
extravascular extracellular space (EES), and they are
intercompatible. All measure combinations of three parameters;
(1) kPSp is the influx volume transfer constant (min-1), or
permeability surface area product per unit volume of tissue,
between plasma and EES; (2) ve is the volume of EES space per
unit volume of tissue (0 < ve < 1); and (3) K(ep), the efflux
rate constant (min-1), is the ratio of the first two parameters
(k(ep) = kPSp/ve). The ratio K(ep) is the simplest to measure,
requiring only signal linearity with Gd tracer concentration or,
alternatively, a measurement of T1 before injection of Gd (T10).
To measure the physiologic parameters kPSp and ve separately

using a 3.0 T Bruker Biospec magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scanner in normal adults with no clinical evidence of
neurological disease. Nineteen subjects, 8 female and 11 male,
were studied for T1 and T2 measurements, and 7 males were studied
for T2. Measurements were made using a saturation recovery method
for T1, a multiple spin-echo experiment for T2, and a fast
low-angle shot (FLASH) sequence with 14 different echo times for
T2. Results of the measurements are summarized as follows.
Average T1 values measured for gray matter and white matter were
1331 and 832 msec, respectively. Average T2 values measured for
gray matter and white matter were 80 and 110 msec, respectively.
The average T2 values for occipital and frontal gray matter were
41.6 and 51.8 msec, respectively. Average T2 values for occipital
and frontal white matter were 48.4 and 44.7 msec, respectively.
ANOVA tests of the measurements revealed that for both gray and
white matter there were no significant differences in T1 from one
location in the brain to another. T2 in occipital gray matter was
significantly higher (0.0001 < P < .0375) than the rest of the
gray matter, while T2 in frontal white matter was significantly
lower (P < 0.0001). Statistical analysis of cerebral hemispheric
differences in relaxation time measurements showed no significant
differences in T1 values from the left hemisphere compared with
the right, except in insular gray matter, where this difference
was significant at P = 0.0320. No significant difference in T2
values existed between the left and right cerebral hemispheres.
Significant differences were apparent between male and female

    abstract = {PURPOSE: To quantitatively evaluate the kinetic parameter
estimation for head and neck (HN) dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)
MRI with dual-flip-angle (DFA) T1 mapping. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
Clinical DCE-MRI datasets of 23 patients with HN tumors were
included in this study. T1 maps were generated based on
multiple-flip-angle (MFA) method and different DFA combinations.
Tofts model parameter maps of k(ep), K(trans) and v(p) based on
MFA and DFAs were calculated and compared. Fitted parameter by
MFA and DFAs were quantitatively evaluated in primary tumor,
salivary gland and muscle. RESULTS: T1 mapping deviations by DFAs
produced remarkable kinetic parameter estimation deviations in
head and neck tissues. In particular, the DFA of [2º, 7º]
overestimated, while [7º, 12º] and [7º, 15º] underestimated
K(trans) and v(p), significantly (P<0.01). [2º, 15º] achieved the
smallest but still statistically significant overestimation for
K(trans) and v(p) in primary tumors, 32.1\% and 16.2\%
respectively. k(ep) fitting results by DFAs were relatively close
to the MFA reference compared to K(trans) and v(p). CONCLUSIONS:
T1 deviations induced by DFA could result in significant errors
in kinetic parameter estimation, particularly K(trans) and v(p),
through Tofts model fitting. MFA method should be more reliable
and robust for accurate quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis in
head and neck.},
