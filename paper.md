# Summary

We present the results of the ISMRM 2020 joint Reproducible Research and Quantitative MR study groups reproducibility challenge on T<sub>1</sub> mapping in phantom and human brain. T<sub>1</sub> mapping, a widely used quantitative MRI technique, exhibits inconsistent tissue-specific values across protocols, sites, and vendors. The challenge aimed to assess the reproducibility of a well-established inversion recovery T1 mapping technique, with acquisition details published solely as a PDF, on a standardized phantom and in human brains. Participants acquired T<sub>1</sub> mapping data from MRIs of three manufacturers at 3T, resulting in 39 phantom datasets and 56 datasets from healthy human subjects. The T<sub>1</sub> inter-submission variability was twice as high as the intra-submission variability in both phantoms and human brains, indicating that the acquisition details in the selected paper were insufficient to reproduce a quantitative MRI protocol. This study reports the inherent uncertainty in  T<sub>1</sub> measures across independent research groups, bringing us one step closer to a practical clinical baseline of  T<sub>1</sub> variations in vivo. This challenge resulted in the creation of a comprehensive open database of T<sub>1</sub> mapping acquisitions, accessible at [osf.io/ywc9g/](https://osf.io/ywc9g/), and an [interactive dashboard](https://rrsg2020.db.neurolibre.org) for wider community access and engagement.

# Acknowledgements

The conception of this collaborative reproducibility challenge originated from discussions with experts, including Paul Tofts, Joëlle Barral, and Ilana Leppert, who provided valuable insights. Additionally, Kathryn Keenan, Zydrunas Gimbutas, and Andrew Dienstfrey from NIST provided their code to generate the ROI template for the ISMRM/NIST phantom. Dylan Roskams-Edris and Gabriel Pelletier from the Tanenbaum Open Science Institute (TOSI) offered valuable insights and guidance related to data ethics and data sharing in the context of this international multi-center conference challenge. The 2020 RRSG study group committee members who launched the challenge, Martin Uecker, Florian Knoll, Nikola Stikov, Maria Eugenia Caligiuri, and Daniel Gallichan, as well as the 2020 qMRSG committee members, Kathryn Keenan, Diego Hernando, Xavier Golay, Annie Yuxin Zhang, and Jeff Gunter, also played an essential role in making this challenge possible. We would also like to thank the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP), the Quebec Bioimaging Network (QBIN), and the Montreal Heart Institute Foundation for their support in creating the NeuroLibre preprint. Finally, we extend our thanks to all the volunteers and individuals who helped with the scanning at each imaging site.

The authors thank the ISMRM Reproducible Research Study Group for conducting a code review of the code (Version 1) supplied in the Data Availability Statement. The scope of the code review covered only the code’s ease of download, quality of documentation, and ability to run, but did not consider scientific accuracy or code efficiency.

Lastly, we acknowledge use of ChatGPT (v3), a generative language model, for accelerating manuscript preparation. The co-first authors employed ChatGPT in the initial draft for transforming bullet point sentences into paragraphs, proofreading for typos, and refining the academic tone. ChatGPT served exclusively as a writing aid, and was not used to create or interpret results.
